# Police Complaint Filing System

This is a police complaint filing system that utilizes blockchain technology to ensure decentralization without third-party interference. Users can register their complaints and receive a complaint ID. Using this ID, they can check the status of their complaint and view any remarks made by officers. The system also includes an officer interface where officers can approve, discard, or resolve complaints by providing remarks. This approach offers a more traditional and democratic way to handle complaint filing without involving third parties.

## Instructions

1. **Connect a MetaMask Wallet**: You need to have a MetaMask wallet connected to the website.
